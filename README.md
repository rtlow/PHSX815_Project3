# PHSX815_Project3

Photon detection is expected to be a Poisson process. However, the rate parameter that noise follows depends nontrivially on other parameters. The code in this repository simulates the detection of photons on a single pixel for a user-defined number of measurements over a user-defined number of experiments, taking these confounding factors in account.

## Dependencies

- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

## Example Usage

The executable files are `python/PhotonCounter.py` and `python/PhotonHypoTest.py`, and can be called from the command line with the -h flag, which will print the options.

The file `python/PhotonCounter.py` generates the Poisson-distributed data according to each model. The user can specify the model using either the `--model0` or `--model1` flag, and can alter the number of Experiments and Measurements per Experiment using the -Nexp and -Nmeas options respectively.

`model0` is the noise model. Noise electrons have an energy spectrum according to the Fermi-Dirac distriubtion. The number of noise electrons detected is the number of electrons above the Fermi level. This number is obtained via numerical integration of the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The `-T` flag allows the user to specify the temperature of Fermi-Dirac distribution. The `-Nfree` flag allows the user to specify the number of free electrons in the pixel.

`model1` is the signal model. Atmospheric seeing causes the observed intensity of a point source to dance around the detector. We model this by sampling the Airy disk using Metropolis-Hastings sampling. The `-I0` flag allows the user to set the max intensity of starlight. The `-seeing` flag allows the user to set the mean seeing of the atmosphere. The `-Nburn` flag allows the user to specify how many initial samples to exclude. The `-Nskip` flag allows the user to skip a certain number of samples, since the Metropolis-Hastings method may have unwanted periodicity.

The file `python/PhotonHypoTest.py` analyzes two data files from `PhotonCounter.py`. These two data files, with different models, represent two different hypotheses. The user can specify a significance level for hypothesis testing using the `-alpha` option.
