# PHSX815_Project3

Photon detection is expected to be a Poisson process. However, the rate parameter that noise follows depends nontrivially on other parameters. The code in this repository simulates the detection of photons on a single pixel for a user-defined number of measurements over a user-defined number of experiments, taking these confounding factors in account.

## Dependencies

- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

## Example Usage

The executable files are `python/NoiseCounter.py` and `python/NoiseOptimize.py`, and can be called from the command line with the -h flag, which will print the options.
